String == it is a class use to Create String Object (Group of object)
it is Present in java.lang package.
it is used to Create immutable String object.
it inherits 3 interface which are --
	CharSequence-> it is used to maintain the sequence of the Characters in Object.

	Comparable-> it is used to compare to String Object lexogra  phically(Alphabetically)

	Serialization -> it is used to maintain the state of the Object.

there are 2 Way in which we can Create String Object.
1. Using String Literal.
Syntax --
	String variable = "String Literal";

2. Using New Keyword,
Syntax --
	String variable = new String ("String Literal");

What is String Constant Pool?
It is a memory Store inside the Heap Area to Store the object
of String class created using String Literal Directly.

Why String Class is Immutable?
Immutable means unchanged OR unmodifiable

In string class,Object are created inside String constant pool,
Which returns same address for different object creation with same data 
where if 1 reference try to change the data of the object it will be affecting other reference also.
Hence, String class are Immutable
